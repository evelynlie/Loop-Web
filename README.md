## Overview
Loop Cinemas is a long running cinema operator with several cinema locations around Australia. They focus on a premium, unique experience and bringing community into their cinema experiences. In addition to displaying the latest and greatest films, Loop also holds a few community events, art shows and the like at their locations.

Loop Web will help potential customers discover upcoming films, session times and see ratings and reviews from other moviegoers.

An Admin Dashboard is also created to allow Loop Cinemas admin to create, edit, and delete movie information that is displayed on Loop Web.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
